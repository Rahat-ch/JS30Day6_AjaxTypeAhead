# JS30Day6_AjaxTypeAhead

This was a super useful lesson and I cannot wait to implement this in some of my own personal projects. We created a search engine that matched the user input with results in the array to get a result that matches. For example if I started typing Boston I would get a result that included those letters like Boston Massachusetts. 

This is definetely going to put a nice professional touch on some of my future projects! 

And of course the deployed project:
